<pre> ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | <b>"I build systems that replace busywork, not just features."</b> | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Most SaaS and internal tools today are stitched together with manual patches, scattered spreadsheets, and siloed apps. Founders lose hours toggling between Notion, Slack, Sheets, Stripe, and Email. <b>I do not build features; I build operational clarity.</b> Engineering, at its core, is about removing friction. Whether I am creating dashboards that give non-technical SaaS founders real-time insight, designing client management systems that unify scattered data, or automating repetitive workflows, my goal remains the same: <b>Founder Autonomy at Scale.</b> If a process requires human intervention twice, it is a failure. If critical data lives in five separate tools, it is an inefficiency. I bridge the gap between messy workflows and smooth, automated systems because that is where SaaS founders lose their time—and revenue. I am not here to maintain the status quo; I am here to set it. I build for clarity, automate for scale, and structure for permanence. <b>The proof is in the systems, the dashboards, and the data.</b> ------------------------------------------------------------------------- </pre>
